# Fire-smoke-safety-system.
Arduino-based fire safety system with 2-stage response. Level 1: Smoke detected → LED blinks, fan turns on. Level 2: Smoke + high temp → LED blinks, buzzer activates, servo motor turns 90 to open tap for water. Uses MQ-2 gas sensor, LM34 temp sensor, L293D Motor Driver. Simulated in Proteus.
