# ðŸ”¥ Arduino-Based Fire & Smoke Detection System

This is a smart fire safety system developed using *Arduino UNO* and simulated on *Proteus*. The system provides a two-level response based on smoke detection and temperature rise.

---

## ðŸš¨ Features

### âœ… Level 1: Smoke Detected (Early Warning)
- *Sensor:* MQ-2 Gas Sensor
- *Actions:*
  - LED blinks
  - DC motor with fan turns ON to disperse smoke

### ðŸ”¥ Level 2: Smoke + High Temperature (Fire Condition)
- *Sensors:* MQ-2 + LM34 Temperature Sensor
- *Actions:*
  - LED blinks
  - Buzzer activates
  - Servo rotates to simulate turning on a water tap

---

## ðŸ§  Working Logic

- *Temperature Threshold:* ~134Â°F (â‰ˆ56Â°C)
- *Servo Angle:*
  - 90Â° (safe state / fan blowing smoke)
  - 0Â° (fire state / water tap simulation)
- *Safe State Reset:* All components reset if no danger is detected.
